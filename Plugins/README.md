# Plugins

### `TestPlugin`

Simple stub plugin for debugging and testing. Just ignore this one.

### `CommandProcessor`

Plugin for user interaction using commands from Discord messages. Commands are actual `class`es which can't communicate with the API right now. Only supports simple text responses right now. You can do whatever you want though within the commands to form your response.

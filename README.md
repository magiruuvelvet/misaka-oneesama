Plugin-based Discord Bot with Desktop and Web UI for configuration

#### Overview

**ATTENTION: In development!**

Misaka-oneesama is an upcoming bot for Discord™ which is fully plugin-based and doesn't offer any functionality on its own. It will provide an Plugin API and a graphical configuration. The user interface is accessible from the built-in Electron powered desktop app aswell from web browsers over HTTP. Whatever you prefer more.

I plan to use Discord.js to communicate with Discord™ and develop some plugins by myself to use with the bot.

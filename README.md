Discord Bot with Web UI and Plugin support

![](...)
<br><br><br>

#### Overview

**ATTENTION: In development!**

Misaka-oneesama is an upcoming bot for Discord™ with a Web-based configuration panel and plugin support. It will provide a simple Plugin API and a graphical configuration. The web interface is accessible via HTTP.

I plan to develop some plugins by myself to use with the bot.


#### Things used to build this bot

 - [Qt](https://www.qt.io)
 - [QDiscord](https://github.com/george99g/QDiscord) ─ Qt C++ Discord API wrapper by [george99g](https://github.com/george99g)
 - [QtWebApp](http://stefanfrings.de/qtwebapp/index-en.html) ─ Qt C++ HTTP Server by [Stefan Frings](http://stefanfrings.de)

#### Support Platforms

All Qt supported platforms should be supported. Originally this is a personal bot and it needs to work mainly on FreeBSD only, which is the OS of my choice for servers.
